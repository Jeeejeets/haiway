## Best Practices

- **[Testing](testing.md)** - Testing strategies and patterns for Haiway applications

## Learning Path

If you're new to Haiway, we recommend following this learning path:

1. **Start with [Architecture](architecture.md)** - Understand the fundamental design principles
2. **Learn [State Management](state-management.md)** - Master immutable data structures and validation
3. **Explore [Context System](context-system.md)** - Understand scoped execution and dependency injection
4. **Study [Functionality Patterns](functionality-patterns.md)** - Learn how to implement features using functional patterns
5. **Plan with [Package Organization](package-organization.md)** - Structure your projects for maintainability
6. **Practice [Async Patterns](async-patterns.md)** - Handle concurrency and async operations
7. **Master [Testing](testing.md)** - Ensure your applications are reliable

Each guide builds upon concepts from previous ones, providing a comprehensive understanding of Haiway's capabilities.
