# Haiway

A Python framework for functional programming with structured concurrency, designed for dependency injection and state management.

## Overview

Haiway is a Python framework (3.12+) that emphasizes:

- **Immutable State Management**: Type-safe, immutable data structures with validation
- **Context-based Dependency Injection**: Safe state propagation in concurrent environments
- **Functional Approach**: Pure functions over objects with methods
- **Structured Concurrency**: Automatic task management and resource cleanup

## Key Features

### ðŸ”’ **Immutable by Design**
All state objects are immutable by default, ensuring thread safety and predictable behavior in concurrent environments.

### âš¡ **Context-Based DI**
Scoped execution environments with automatic dependency injection and resource management.

### ðŸ§ª **Testing-Friendly**
Built-in support for mocking and testing with clear separation of concerns.

### ðŸ“Š **Observability**
Optional OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing and monitoring.
